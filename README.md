# Hand Gesture Control with OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project demonstrates real-time hand gesture control using OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries in Python. By leveraging the webcam feed, it allows users to interact with their computer screen through hand gestures, enabling actions like left-click, right-click, and double-click, as well as text selection and dragging.

## Features

- **Hand Detection:** Utilizes the MediaPipe Hands model to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time from the webcam feed.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognizes specific hand gestures such as thumb-index distance for left-click, thumb-pinky distance for right-click, and double-click detection.
- **Text Selection:** Enables users to select text on the screen by bringing their thumb tip close to their index finger tip.
- **Dragging:** Allows users to drag selected text or objects on the screen by holding down the left-click gesture while moving their hand.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

```bash
python hand_gesture_control.py
```

2. Position your hand in front of the webcam.
3. Perform gestures according to the specified actions:
   - Thumb and index finger close together for left-click.
   - Thumb and pinky finger close together for right-click.
   - Thumb and index finger tips close together for text selection.
   - Double-click by quickly tapping thumb and index finger tips twice.
   - Drag by selecting text or object and moving your hand while holding down left-click gesture.
4. Press 'q' to quit the application.

## Customization

- Adjust distance thresholds (`thumb_index_distance_threshold`, `thumb_pinky_distance_threshold`) for gesture recognition as per your preference.
- Modify `double_click_threshold` to change the time window for double-click detection.
- Update `text_selection_threshold` to adjust the sensitivity for text selection.
